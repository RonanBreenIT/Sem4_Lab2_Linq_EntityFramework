Lab 2


Task 1 – LINQ (Fleet)

A fleet is a collection of cars. Each car has a make, model, registration and engine size (cc). Implement a car class and override ToString() as usual. Create a fleet collection in memory and populate with some cars.

Write LINQ queries on the fleet to:
1. List all cars in ascending registration order
2. List the models for all Mazda cars in the fleet
3. List all cars in descending engine size order
4. List just the make and model for cars whose engine size is 1600 cc
5. Count the number of cars whose engine size is 1600 cc or less


Task 2 – Entity Framework (PhoneBookv1)

Design and implement a console application which allows adding, updating, and deleting of data in a phone book database. Use the Entity Framework for this purpose, Code First approach. A SQL Server Express LocalDB will suffice. Each entry in the phone book contains a phone number (unique), a name, and an address. Have the application insert, update, and delete entries, and provide the following queries:

1. Report the full contents of the phone book in name order
2. Report the name and address for specified phone number.
3. Report phone numbers and addresses matching a specified name.
